### Python3 and ML experiments

Likelihood = probability

ML Process:
1. data collection (pd.read_csv('...csv'))
2. data exploration (df.shape, df.info(), df.describe() plot charts...)
3. data preparation (check missing data, normalize data, split train/test data..)

These 3 steps get 80% of the time

4. modeling (train model via train data)
5. evaluation (accuracy of the model comparing test run results with real data)

These 2 steps iterate to find model that have the best accuracy rate

6. actionable insight
